      <h1>Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
      <p>
        The IDEA management team is led by 27 Northeastern Undergraduate students from
        varying educational backgrounds that are passionate about helping ventures succeed
        and growing the IDEA program to reach its full potential. By being on the management
        team, you get hands-on experience working with entrepreneurs on a daily basis and is a
        great way to get involved with other entrepreneurship enthusiasts. Pursuing a Business
        degree is not a requirement to join the management team; we encourage everyone to
        apply, as long as you are curious and want to learn more about entrepreneurship. No
        matter your qualifications, you will surely find something that fits your interests in the
        management team.

        <h1>Marketing and Events Team</h1>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The Marketing and Events team deals primarily with managing all
          messages that go out to the community, across all channels of
          interest (social media, medium blog, e-mail newsletters, etc.). This
          team is also responsible for organizing events both within and
          outside of the Northeastern entrepreneurial community, as well as
          executing the marketing campaigns that precede those. If you have
          a creative eye, are a social media wiz, or if you are a talented writer,
          this is probably the team for you.

          interacting with student clubs, University professors, and service providers to actively manage and enhance
          the IDEA venture community through direct communication, proactive engagement, providing better access to

          also part of this team’s responsibilities. Join us if you have some technical background and are passionate

          resources. This includes, but is not limited to: designing the venture
          experience through our program, communicating directly with
          ventures, running information sessions and events, and providing
          constructive feedback. Join us if you’re passionate about helping
