    Another way to get involved with IDEA is by becoming a Coach. The ideal candidate for a Coach is
    someone who has some type of industry expertise.
  </p>
  <p class="coach-roles">
    There are two ways to get involved as a Coach: either as a Venture Coach or as a Ready Stage Coach.
    For Ready Stage Coaches, the expertise needed is more about product or service validation; for
    Venture Coaches, itâ€™s all about the business model development.

          Ventures Coaches have the opportunity to work with ventures that align more with their area of
          expertise and will have a one on one relationship with a venture. You are expected to check in regularly,
          and should have an ongoing, working relationship with your venture. As a Venture Coach, you will
          have the opportunity to dive deep into helping entrepreneurs solve problems about their business model.

        <p class="mt-2 \">
          Ready stage coaches will not have a designated venture, but rather they will work with any and all
          ventures that need insight mostly through weekly coaching sessions. Ventures going through the
          program will sign-up for office hours and you will be there to help answer questions.
