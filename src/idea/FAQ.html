            <h3 class="pb-2">What is IDEA?</h3>
            <p>
              IDEA is a student-led venture accelerator that supports entrepreneurs in the Northeastern community
              to reach their full potential. True to our Northeastern roots, IDEA provides a valuable experiential
              educational opportunity to everyone involved from the ventures and coaches to the management
              team and full-time staff.
            </p>

          <div class="info pb-4">
            <h3 class="pb-2">How can I get involved?</h3>
            <p>
              There are three ways to get involved - being on the management team, starting a venture, or
              becoming a coach. Positions on the management team generally open up around a month or two
              before the end of the semester to be part of it the following one. To get involved as a venture, you
              have to attend a New Venture Orientation which is a short information session on IDEA and our
              process. To become a coach, you may apply anytime on our website here.

            <h3 class="pb-2">What are the different stages of IDEA and what do they mean?</h3>
            <p>
              The IDEA program is split up into three stages: ready, set, and go. Ventures in the program begin at
              the Ready stage which is focused on customer validation. From there ventures will move to the Set
              stage after conducting a solutions design pitch. In the set stage ventures begin to build their business
              model. From the Set stage ventures arrive in Go where they are beginning to execute their model
              bringing the business to life.

            <h3 class="pb-2">How long does it take to get through the IDEA program?</h3>
            <p>
              There is no fixed timeline to get through the program and we allow ventures to work at their own
              pace. Ventures with more time on their hand may go through the IDEA program at a faster rate than
              others, but there is no “minimum” or “maximum”.

          <div class="info pb-4">
            <h3 class="pb-2">If I am not Northeastern affiliated will you still provide me resources
              and feedback on my venture?</h3>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, we cannot extend our resources and knowledge to those not affiliated with
              Northeastern. In order for you to enroll in IDEA you must be either a current student (undergraduate,
              graduate, or PhD), alumni, or faculty & staff.

          <div class="info pb-4">
            <h3 class="pb-2">Who does IDEA partner with?</h3>
            <p>
              IDEA continues to partner with the Northeastern entrepreneurial ecosystem groups and also has a list
              of service providers who do pro-bono work for ventures in different areas of their growth.

              Unfortunately, the IDEA lab is available for use specifically for the management team members and for
              ventures who need one. The lab is not open to the public except when we are hosting events.
